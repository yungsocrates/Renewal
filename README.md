## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Required packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nycdoe-substitute-renewal-analytics.git
   cd nycdoe-substitute-renewal-analytics
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your CSV files in the project directory:
   - `substitute_paraprofessionals.csv` (current data)
   - `substitute_teachers.csv` (current data)
   - `substitute_paraprofessionals_old.csv` (optional - for comparison)
   - `substitute_teachers_old.csv` (optional - for comparison)

## 📈 Usage

### Standard Mode (Single Dataset Analysis)
```bash
python substitute_renewal_analytics.py
```

### Comparison Mode (Historical Data Comparison)
To enable comparison mode, place historical data files with "_old" suffix:
- `substitute_paraprofessionals_old.csv`
- `substitute_teachers_old.csv`

The script will automatically detect these files and:
- Calculate differences between current and historical data
- Display changes with ▲/▼ indicators in the HTML report
- Show percentage changes for completion rates
- Include comparison summaries in terminal output

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from substitute_renewal_analytics import main, analyze_substitute_paraprofessionals, analyze_substitute_teachers

# Run full analysis
main()

# Or analyze individual datasets
import pandas as pd
df_para = pd.read_csv('substitute_paraprofessionals.csv')
para_results = analyze_substitute_paraprofessionals(df_para)
```

## 🔄 Comparison Analytics

The tool supports historical data comparison to track changes over time:

### Key Features:
- **Automatic Detection**: Automatically detects "_old" CSV files for comparison
- **Change Indicators**: Visual indicators (▲ for increase, ▼ for decrease) in HTML reports
- **Completion Rate Tracking**: Percentage point changes in SPA and STE completion rates
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Comparison across all analysis categories
- **Terminal Summary**: Quick overview of changes in command-line output

### Example Output:
```
📊 Comparison Mode: Old data files detected
  Para Old Data: ✓
  Teacher Old Data: ✓

Substitute Paraprofessionals:
  • Total Eligible: 15,234 (+234)
  • Completed: 12,567 (+189)
  • Completion Rate: 82.5% (+1.2%)
```
